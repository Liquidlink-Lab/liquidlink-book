### Points System

This system integrates on-chain and off-chain components to enable point request creation from other protocols and dashboard querying from the frontend. The process consists of the following steps:
1.Other Protocol
A protocol sends an on-chain transaction to Liquidlink package using the send_add_point_req function. This creates a request to add points for a user.

2.Liquidlink
After receiving the request, Liquidlink logs the request on-chain. The Indexer then listens to and fetches these on-chain events, processing them and adding the data to a dashboard (share object)

3.Frontend
The frontend application queries the Indexer to retrieve point data and user information from the dashboard, which is then displayed to users in the UI.

### Share Points System

This system integrates both on-chain and off-chain components to manage referral relationships and point distribution between inviters and invitees.

### Process Flow:

Off-chain Referral Code Creation & Input
1. An Inviter generates a referral code via the Frontend Referral module.
    - An Invitee inputs this referral code in the frontend.
    - The frontend then sends this information to the Backend, which stores the inviter-invitee relationship off-chain.

2. Point Distribution via Liquidlink
    - When an admin triggers add_point_by_admin(), Liquidlink retrieves inviter and invitee information from the Share package.
    - Based on this information, points are distributed accordingly to both the inviter and invitee.
