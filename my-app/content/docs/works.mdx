title: How Liquidlink works?
---

LiquidLink provides an on-chain points system that ensures fairness through blockchain transparency.

We utilize Move contracts to collect on-chain objects and aggregate them into leaderboards, allowing each user to clearly see their contribution score to a given product.
Whether your project is in : 
- GameFi 
- Lending 
- DEX 
- CDP 
- LST

 LiquidLink can be seamlessly integrated to support comprehensive score tracking and aggregation.
