This page shows how to integrate MetaMask with IOTA Snap in a Next.js frontend so users can log in to IOTA with MetaMask.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

- MetaMask desktop extension installed and unlocked

- Next.js project (App Router or Pages Router)

### Install

```js
# Nextjs
npm create next-app@latest --ts
```



```js
# Add the IOTA Snap integration
npm install @liquidlink-lab/iota-snap-for-metamask
```



#### Import
```js
import {
metaMaskAvailable,
registerIotaSnapWallet,
} from "@liquidlink-lab/iota-snap-for-metamask";
```



### Integration Steps 

1. Check MetaMask availability : Use metaMaskAvailable() to confirm MetaMask is present. Avoid calling wallet APIs during SSR.

2. Register IOTA Snap wallet: Call registerIotaSnapWallet() to add the IOTA Snap provider into your wallet registry/list. MetaMask may prompt users to install/enable the Snap.

3. Connect Iota snap to login: Trigger the provider’s connect flow from your UI to let users log in to IOTA with MetaMask and manage their IOTA account.

Although you can use the IOTA Snap to sign transactions and manage your wallet, MetaMask cannot display IOTA wallet assets. You can use snap.liquidlink.io to manage your asset
